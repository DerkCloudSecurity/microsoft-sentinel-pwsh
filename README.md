# microsoft-sentinel-powershell

A collection of custom functions, scripts, and modules that I have wrote to more efficiently and effectively manage Microsoft Sentinel and its relevant resources. `Management` in this case includes tasks like:
- Constructing the required infrastructure for new Sentinel workspaces
- Configuring these workspaces with the settings and solutions that I have found most useful throughout my experience
- to deploy Sentinel resources (resources help within their own repositories) including Analytics rules, Automation rules, (customized) Workbooks, Watchlists, and most importantly to install and configure data connectors
- To manage (e.g. update, remove, export, etc.) all the Sentinel resources mentioned above
